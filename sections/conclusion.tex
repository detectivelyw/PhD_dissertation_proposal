\paragraph{Conclusion}\mbox{}\\

During my PhD study, the research problem that I have been focused on is that virtual machines and containers have security concerns of 
triggering zero-day bugs in a vulnerable host operating system kernel. To solve this problem, we first studied and developed a ``popular paths'' metric 
that revealed a strong correlation between the popularity of kernel code and the likelihood that it contains security bugs. We then designed and developed 
a system to apply our popular paths metric to the LinuxKit virtual machine. As our current on-going work, we have obtained the popular paths data for the LinuxKit VM, 
and instrumented the Linux kernel source code based on this data. We are now running our testing containers on the modified host kernel, and verifying that 
real-world popular Docker containers can run their default workload using the popular paths. Next, we will extend our current work to automate the application of our 
popular paths metric across multiple kernel versions. We also plan to automate the profiling of popular paths data on a large-scale dataset of containers. Our hope is that 
by the end of my PhD study, we will be able to demonstrate that the popular paths metric is an effective solution to enhancing container security by avoiding kernel vulnerabilities, 
and can be used in practice to benefit both security researchers and container users.
