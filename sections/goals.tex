\paragraph{Goals}\mbox{}\\

The ultimate goal of our work is to improve security of virtualization systems and containers by preventing them from triggering kernel vulnerabilities. 
To do so, we first establish a quantitative security metric to predict the locations of zero-day kernel bugs. 
We then study and demonstrate the feasibility of applying our metric to real-world Docker containers. 
Lastly, we will automate and generalize the application of our metric to multiple kernel versions, and large-scale container applications.
